- **Parsing** — Read moves (SAN, UCI), positions (FEN), and games (PGN).  
- **Formatting** — Convert moves, positions, and games to multiple string formats.  
- **Move generation** — Generate all legal moves for any position.  
- **Documentation** — Comprehensive API reference with examples. [See the docs →](https://igorqs.github.io/chesscxx/)
